* I am currently learning React and front end design for web.

# Technical Background
I have the most experience in Java and C, and some in Python and Javascript.

I also have several years of experience in the Adobe Suite - particularly, Lightroom and Photoshop as well as Premier pro and Illustrator.

Some projects I've done for my classes are a text based galdiator game, an adventure game built in JavaFx, and an implementation of Connect 4 in C and Scheme.
